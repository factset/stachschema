This schema defines the format of tabular data, the relationships between columns, rows, headers, and metadata, and the binding of tables to charts. It is meant to standardize the format of tabular data between the service layer and the user interface layer.

## Overview

Tables can be more complex than a two-dimensional array of data. There are structural relationships that are important for understanding how data is related in order to facilitate human consumption. By retaining this information, it allows these relationships created in one application to be carried over to another application without having to redo this work. Once those relationships are defined, they can drive how tables are bound to charts.
