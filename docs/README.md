This schema defines the format of tabular data, the relationships between columns, rows, headers, and metadata, and the binding of tables to charts. It is meant to standardize the format of tabular data between the service layer and the user interface layer.

## Overview

Tables can be more complex than a two-dimensional array of data. There are structural relationships that are important for understanding how data is related in order to facilitate human consumption. By retaining this information, it allows these relationships created in one application to be carried over to another application without having to redo this work. Once those relationships are defined, they can drive how tables are bound to charts.

## Serialization

All JSON properties are serialized using [camel casing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) even though the protobuf schema uses [snake casing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) due to protobuf's [JSON Mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). Therefore, message field names are mapped to lowerCamelCase and become JSON object keys.

## Get Started

### Install

The following SDKs facilitate serialization.

   | Framework | Repository |
   |-----------|------------|
   | DotNet    | https://www.nuget.org/packages/FactSet.Protobuf.Stach/    |
   | Java      | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.factset.protobuf |
   | Python    | https://pypi.org/project/fds.protobuf.stach/ |
   | R         | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/factset.protobuf.stach/index.html |
   
### Build

#### Generating source code

Compile the `.proto` files into generated source code files to facilitate serialization by using the [protobuf compiler](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). Follow the [instructions](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#generating) for your preferred language.

#### Generating SDKs

Run the `Generate.bat` script.

The following dependencies need to be installed:
- [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) v3.12.4
- [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) latest
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.14.3
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) v3.6.3
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12.18.2
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) v3.6.1

!> Note: Work is being done to remove the need for all of these dependencies, and automate this process.
