# STACH v1

This version focused on satisfying the most complex case for representing a table.

We needed to be able to generically describe tables with row groups, collapsed columns, multiple rows of headers, complex metadata, as well as be able to compress the data to achieve the smallest size possible when transferring the data.

The intent was to keep the schema as simple as possible while still be able to represent this complexity.

Please review the accompanying [documentation](v1/ColumnOrganized) to understand how to use this version STACH.
